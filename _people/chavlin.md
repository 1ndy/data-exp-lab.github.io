Chris Havlin earned his undergraduate degree in Geophysics and Planetary Sciences from Boston University in 2009, followed by a MSc (2011) and PhD (2015) in Geological Sciences from Brown University. His research in computational geodynamics focused on two-phase flow in the upper mantle to better understand how magma migration influences plate tectonics and how partial melt distributions influence seismic observation. From 2015-2020, Chris continued research in geodynamics and geophysics at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, while also providing freelance data science consulting services. Chris joined the Data Exploration Lab in June, 2020, where he works on developing and leveraging open source computational tools for data visualization and analysis in the geosciences.
