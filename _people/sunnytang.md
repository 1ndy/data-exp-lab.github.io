Sunny is currently a graduate student in the Astronomy Department. He is interested in the role of magnetic fields and turbulence in the process of star formation. His current research is currently focused on the development of [Dengo], a meta-solver for non-equilibrium chemical network with cooling processes. This is essential to the study of wide range of astrophysical processes. In partiular, I and Matt are interested in the physics that leads to the formation of first stars. With Dengo, we will hopefully push current first stars simulations to unprecedented boundaries and see the first lights of these objects.
