Tali is an Informatics PhD student in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign's School of Information Sciences. They received their Bachelors of Arts in Physics in 2020 from New College of Florida. They are interested in the cross-section of data visualization and astrophysics and would like to create astrophysical visualizations that are beautiful, scientifically sound, and accessible to everyone. They also hope to venture into other fields of scientific inquiry, such as paleontology, to address discrepancies in the way that data is shared, utilized, and visualized.
