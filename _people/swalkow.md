Sam Walkow is a PhD student studying data visualization and research software. She received her bachelors in Psychology and Sociology from Purdue University in 2014. Her areas of interest include how software is used across science domains, how different domains approach data analysis and visualization, and what motivates users to re-use and re-purpose software tools. She also has experience in data management and research software in a healthcare setting, and hopes to expand her knowledge across science domains to build and maintain effective software tools.
