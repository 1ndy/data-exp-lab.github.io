Madicken Munk obtained her undergraduate degree from Oregon State University in
2011 and her PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the University of California,
Berkeley in 2017. Her dissertation work--completed in residence at Oak Ridge National 
Laboratory and the
Berkeley Institute for Data Science--focused on hybrid methods for neutron transport. 
In the nuclear engineering domain she is interested in
computational methods for radiation transport, nuclear reactor physics, and
reactor multiphysics simulations. Beyond that, she is interested in developing
domain-agnostic open-source tools for data analysis and visualization.
