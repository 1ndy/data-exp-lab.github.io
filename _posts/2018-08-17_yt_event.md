The Data Exploration Lab collaborated with the ARM Climate Research Team from the Argonne National Laboratory in a week long coding sprint to create and improve functions for weather radar data in yt. A front end to support and display radial datasets was created, allowing yt to render [2D radial grids and slice plots.] (<script src="https://gist.github.com/ngoldbaum/726395227c346b667e47345ccf7ea2fa.js"</script>)

Functions were created to transform the geographical datasets to display projections using cartopy. Progress was also made on support for georeferencing, and geophysical specific features were added such as longitude, latitude and some annotations. The annotations work on the geographical projections, including [local and global maps.] (<script src="https://gist.github.com/munkm/b3ae86a3c38f0f6906869feb9ecb111e.js"></script>).

Work was also done to simplify the syntax needed to create [cut regions] ("https://slack-files.com/T9KBANEM6-FC32665NU-36b7757806"), providing better support for filtering data similar to gatefilters in Py-ART. 

Future goals include volume rendered radar data, creating a camera view to examine the 3D structure, and creating a colour bar for plots and projections.

Participants: Nathan Goldbaum, Bobby Jackson, Madicken Munk, Zach Sherman, Matt Turk, and Sam Walkow.
