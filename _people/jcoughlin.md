Jared Coughlin earned his undergraduate degree in Astrophysics from Villanova University
in 2011 and his PhD in Physics from the University of Notre Dame in 2018. His dissertation
work -- Time-Dependent Dark Energy and the Flux Power Spectrum of the Lymna \alpha Forest -- focused
on using large-scale cosmological simulations in order to study the effects of time-dependent dark energy
on an observable known as the Lyman \alpha forest. The goal of the project was to determine whether
or not the Lyman \alpha forest can be used as a viable probe of dark energy. In astrophysics, he is
intereseted in dark energy, cosmology, and the formation and evolution of galaxies. Other interests
include developing and promoting open-source software for scientific use, data analysis, and data
visualization.
