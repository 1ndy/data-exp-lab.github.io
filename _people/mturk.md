Dr. Matthew Turk received his undergraduate degree at Northwestern
University in 2003 and his PhD in Physics from Stanford in 2009.  His
research in astrophysics was primarily focused on the way that the
first stars and galaxies formed in the Universe, which has led him to
develop and implement algorithms for data analysis and visualization.
He is interested in understanding how scientists process data,
developing methods both descriptive and prescriptive around analysis,
visualization, and the propagation of information between data and
individuals.
