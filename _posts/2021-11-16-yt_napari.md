Thanks to a recent grant from the [Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), DXL members have 
started some exciting work connecting the open source 
[napari image viewer](https://napari.org) with [yt](https://yt-project.org/). 
The project will develop a yt-napari plugin to improve interoperability with yt, 
allowing yt users to easily load their data into napari.
