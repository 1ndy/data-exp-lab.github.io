In collaboration with Materials Sciences researchers at the University of Illinois, we are proud to work on the [QMC-HAMM](https://qmc-hamm.github.io/) project.
This work is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE DE-SC0020177) under the
working title: "From accurate correlated quantum simulations to mesoscopic
scales," and is led by David Ceperly from the University of Illinois.
