  description: The TesseRACt package is designed to compute concentrations of
    simulated dark matter halos from volume info for particles generated using
    Voronoi tesselation. This technique is advantageous as it is non-parametric,
    does not assume spherical symmetry, and allows for the presence of substructure.
