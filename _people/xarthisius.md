Dr Kacper Kowalik received his undergraduate degree at Nicolaus
Copernicus University (Torun, Poland) in 2008 and his PhD in Astronomy
also from Nicolaus Copernicus University in 2014. His research in
astrophysics was primarily focused on early stages of protoplanetary
formation and circumstellar disks' instabilities. He is interested in
high performance computations -- especially in the domain sciences
where they haven't been widely adopted, developing new ways of sharing
and interacting with large computational datasets, applying industrial
IT solutions to scientific software.
