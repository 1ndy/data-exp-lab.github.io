  bio: Dr. Meagan Lang recieved her undergraduate degree at Pennsylvania State
    University in 2010 and her PhD in Physics from Vanderbilt University in 2015.
    Her research in astr ophysics has included galaxy evolution, galactic dynamics,
    large scale structure, and gravitational waves. Through this work, Meagan
    has developed new tools and techniques for analyzing numerical simulations,
    modeling noise in gravitational wave detectors, and efficient data access.
    Meagan is interested in making connections between astronomy and other field
    s through interdisciplinary research. She is also interested in physics/astronomy
    education and public outreach in the local Champaign-Urbana community.

  bio: Dr. Matthew Turk received his undergraduate degree at Northwestern University
    in 2003 and his PhD in Physics from Stanford in 2009.  His research in astrophysics
    was primarily focused on the way that the first stars and galaxies formed
    in the Universe, which has led him to develop and implement algorithms for
    data analysis and visualization.  He is interested in understanding how scientists
    process data, developing methods both descriptive and prescriptive around
    analysis, visualization, and the propagation of information between data and
    individuals.

  bio: Nathan's research focuses on the dynamics of the interstellar medium, and
    has worked on simulations of the ISM in a Milky-Way like galaxy as well as
    semianlytic models for the evolution of giant molecular clouds. He is also
    a member of the yt project, contributes to the Enzo hydrodynamics code, and
    has contributed to many other open scientific software packages, and is an
    advocate for open, reproducible research.

    University (Torun, Poland) in 2008 and his PhD in Astronomy also from Nicolaus
    Copernicus University in 2014. His research in astrophysics was primarily
    focused on early stages of protoplanetary formation and circumstellar disks'
    instabilities. He is interested in high performance computations -- especially
    in the domain sciences where they haven't been widely adopted, developing
    new ways of sharing and interacting with large computational datasets, applying
    industrial IT solutions to scientific software.
