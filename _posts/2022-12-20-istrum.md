title: NSF Funding to help understand the Earth's upper mantle 
date:  2022-11-16
---

A recent award through the NSF 
[Frontier Research in Earth Sciences](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/frontier-research-earth-sciences-fres) 
(FRES) program will connect members of DXL with a multi-institution team of 
researchers working to understand the mechanical nature of the Earth's 
upper mantle. The project, "**i**nveStigating the **T**ransient **R**heology of 
the **U**pper **M**antle" (**iSTRUM**) seeks to incorporate observations from 
seismology, geodesy, and laboraroty experiments of rock deformation within a 
single modeling framework to refine our understanding of the underlying physical 
laws that control the motion of the upper mantle across timescales.  

DXL member Chris Havlin will lead the University of Illinois team, whose primary role 
will be to provide computational support, including further development of the 
[Very Broadband Rheology Calculator](https://github.com/vbr-calc/vbr) and general 
computational support and training.
