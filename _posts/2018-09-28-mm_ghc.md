Madicken, a postdoc in the DXL, was sponsored along with <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/news/story/ncsa_grace_hopper_celebration_2018">three other</a> NCSA staff members by the NCSA Director's office to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration. Over the past few days, she has been at GHC with 22,000 other attendees in Houston, TX. Madicken is particularly interested in the open source track, which is new at GHC this year.
